Discover
 tape art in this 4-hour, hands-on workshop! One of our seasoned tape 
artists will share with you the secrets of this bold and fascinating 
medium.

We'll start with an intro to the roots of tape art 
(including right here in Berlin), its evolution from street art and 
graffiti culture, and the techniques that make it endlessly versatile. 
Then you'll be led through the essentialsâ€”types of tape, how to use the 
tools, our favorite tape art techniques, and what you need to know to 
create a sick tape artwork of your own. 

You'll have plenty of 
time to explore and create your own A3-sized artwork using colorful 
adhesive tapes. Throughout the workshop, you'll get expert guidance to 
help you refine your vision and bring your ideas to life. 

From 
clean, geometric lines to flowing curves, this art form is all about 
experimenting and finding your unique style. Tape is a forgiving medium â€“
 there are no mistakes! No experience is necessaryâ€”all materials are 
provided, and the workshop will be max. 20 people and is designed for 
anyone curious about trying something completely new. Youâ€™ll take home 
an A3 board containing your tape artwork. If youâ€™re ready to create more
 tape art at home, additional materials are available for purchase. 
Whether youâ€™re an experienced artist or just looking for a fresh way to 
express yourself, this workshop will show you how you can use tape to 
shape something extraordinary.
