We are thrilled to have Casey Reas as our special guest for a special reading of the 20th Anniversary Processing Community Catalog, a celebration of the art+tech community. This nearly 1000-page book celebrates the achievements and creativity of the Processing community, featuring open-call submissions from those who've explored the potential of Processing, p5.js, and beyond.

We're honored to have Casey Reas joining us for this reading. With Ben Fry, Reas launched Processing in 2001. Processing is an open-source programming language and environment for the visual arts. Processing is widely used by thousands of artists and designers worldwide and by educators teaching programming fundamentals in art and design schools.

Attendees, especially those who have contributed to the catalog, are warmly invited to read a selected page during the event; if you'd like to locate a specific page beforehand, please refer to the online version of the catalog on archive.org.

This event is organized by Creative Code Berlin, an initiative promoting collaboration between artists and coders via two monthly meetups. Find out more about our regularly scheduled events at creativecode.berlin.
