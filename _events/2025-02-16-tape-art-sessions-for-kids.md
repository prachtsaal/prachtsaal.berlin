Let's create with tape! In this 3-hour workshop designed for kids aged 
6â€“13 (accompanied by a guardian), kids will explore the exciting 
possibilities of tape artâ€”a fun and accessible way to create bold, 
unique designs using vibrant adhesive tapes. In this workshop, one of 
our seasoned tape artists will guide young creators through the basics 
of tape art. 

Kids will learn how to cut, layer, and arrange 
vibrant tapes to bring their own unique designs to life. From clean 
geometric lines to playful curves and bold patterns, we encourage 
following the imagination and experimenting.
