Let's create with tape! In this 3-hour workshop designed for kids aged 
6â€“13 (accompanied by a guardian), kids will explore the exciting 
possibilities of tape artâ€”a fun and accessible way to create bold, 
unique designs using vibrant adhesive tapes. In this workshop, one of 
our seasoned tape artists will guide young creators through the basics 
of tape art. 

Kids will learn how to cut, layer, and arrange 
vibrant tapes to bring their own unique designs to life. From clean 
geometric lines to playful curves and bold patterns, we encourage 
following the imagination and experimenting.

Tape Art Sessions are artist-led, artist-run workshops. We bring
the joy, novelty, and versatility of tape art to the hands of the people!
Right here in NeukÃ¶lln, you can learn how to create your very own tape art
piece.  Tape art is an accessible art form â€“ you can do it without any
previous experience. We provide all the materials youâ€™ll need at our monthly
workshops for kids and adults!  Berlin is home to many of todayâ€™s preeminent
tape artists. These workshops pay homage to that history and encourage folks
of all backgrounds to give it a try! Letâ€™s keep the artistic spirit of this
city alive.
