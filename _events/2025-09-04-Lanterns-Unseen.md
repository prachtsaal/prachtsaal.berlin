Prachtsaal will be part of the Berlin New Media Week with a new collective exhibition.<br>

<a href="https://berlinnewmediaweek.com/en/program">Please find the program on the website of the Berlin New Media Week</a>

“Lanterns: Unseen” is a collective exhibition designed explore the complexities of presence and perception in the digital age, showcasing time-based artistic positions and real-time conversations.<br>

In a fleeting moment of encounter, the exhibition offers a glimpse of light that cannot be replicated, inviting viewers to engage and dialogue in a community driven event. <br>

The exhibition features a set of hybrid and multimedia installations. As a community we proposed to host artworks from external artists emphasizing on cooperative art practices. We kept our conceptual framework open to allow for the inclusion of guest works within Prachtsaal's project space. <br>
