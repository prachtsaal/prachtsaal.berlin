Laura is a multidisciplinary artist born in the South of Poland in 1994. She focuses on photography, video, and installation in her artistic practice, merging photographic and sculptural disciplines. Her work touches upon subjects related to tensions and deep connections on the line between nature-human, transcendence, and body as a transgressive power. She is fascinated by notions of trace, trauma, and the subconscious. Her works have been shown in Germany, Norway, France, Poland, and South Korea. She lives and works in Berlin.
