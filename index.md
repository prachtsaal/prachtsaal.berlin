Welcome to **Prachtsaal**—a living junction where artists and audiences meet to experiment, reflect, and reimagine. Rooted in Neukölln, we’re a non-profit cooperative championing bold visual art, performance, and sound. Our space offers affordable ateliers, inclusive programming, and a spirit of radical hospitality. We believe in curiosity as method, play as strategy, and collaboration as catalyst. Step into a community where creativity stretches its limbs and the boundaries of practice are always in flux.
