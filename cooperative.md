## What does cooperative stands for?

We are in the process of registering a non-profit cooperative (gemeinn√ºtzige Genossenschaft) involving all the Prachtsaalians. It will open new possibilities for communities meeting at Prachtsaal and the space itself. In addition to our ateliers, and our daily art practice, we will provide a venue hosting regular concerts and performances, a gallery with constantly rotating exhibitions, and a space for workshops and education.
