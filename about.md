## Who are we?

Welcome to **Prachtsaal**, a living, breathing engine of collective creativity built on two interconnected pillars. One empowers our resident artists, whose work sparks, mutates, and cross-pollinates within the space. The other opens the doors to the public, transforming the studio into a playground of expression, experimentation, and shared knowledge. Our mission is to cultivate the balance between play and purpose, movement and reflection, sound and silence. We welcome everyone driven by curiosity, openness, and the hunger to explore. As a non-profit cooperative, we're here to challenge conventions and co-create a space where art doesn't just exist: it unfolds, provokes, and connects.

**Join us at Prachtsaal—where creation is a process, not a product, and every day invites fresh connections between people, ideas, and worlds.**

## Our mission

At Prachtsaal, we are committed to:

* Showcasing visual art, music, and performance that expand the language of creative expression, and intersect with the social, philosophical, scientific, and technological spheres.
* Providing affordable studio spaces that support sustainable artistic practice.
* Curating inclusive events that resonate with both our local neighborhood and the broader cultural fabric.
* Nurturing intergenerational learning in art and culture.
* Fostering collaborations with international artists on-site, across disciplines and borders.


## How are we achieving our goals

To bring this vision to life, we:

* Offer shared tools, spaces, and materials for multi-medium exploration.
* Build and protect an inclusive, safe, and pluralistic environment.
* Make accessibility a non-negotiable part of our design.
* Operate through a transparent, democratic management model.
* Partner with professionals to sharpen our impact and sustain our mission.
* Develop strategies for long-term financial sustainability.
* Remain proudly and permanently non-profit.


## Prachtsaal: A Cooperative in the Making

We’re in the process of becoming a registered non-profit cooperative (*gemeinnützige Genossenschaft*). This is a pivotal move that will deepen our commitment to collective action and artistic experimentation. What began with ateliers and daily practice is evolving into a full-spectrum platform: concerts, performances, exhibitions, workshops, and a rotating gallery. This transformation isn’t about growth for its own sake. It’s about making room for activity, ideas, use, and joy.

**Let’s reimagine the architecture of art and community together!**
