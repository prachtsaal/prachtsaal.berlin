## Who are we?

Welcome to Prachtsaal, a vibrant and dynamic creative nexus, built on two interconnected pillars. One empowers our resident artists, who infuse the space and inspire each other with cutting-edge innovation. The other invites the public into a dynamic playground for expression, exploration, exchange, and education. Our mission is to cultivate an environment teeming with playfulness and purpose, movement and reflection, color and sound, discovery and growth. We eagerly welcome everyone with an open mind, tolerance, and curiosity to join us. As a non-profit cooperative, we are committed to pushing the boundaries of community enrichment.

Join us at Prachtsaal, where creativity knows no bounds and every day is an invitation to explore, learn, and grow together!

## Prachtsaal: A Cooperative in the Making

We are embarking on an exciting journey to become a registered non-profit cooperative (gemeinn√ºtzige Genossenschaft). This new chapter will unlock fresh realms of community engagement and transform our space into a dynamic hub of creativity. Beyond our ateliers and daily art practices, we will host regular concerts and performances, curate a gallery with ever-evolving exhibitions, and offer a lively space for workshops and education. Join us as we reimagine the future of art and community together!
