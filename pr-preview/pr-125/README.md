# prachtsaal.berlin

The website of Prachtsaal Studios.
It is developed using Jekyll and tailwindcss. 

Jekyll allows you to edit markdown files, which are then compiled and integrated into a static html, javascript, and css site; Jekyll is what is called a static site generator. 

tailwindcss is a css framework which allows you to define css using user friendly classes in your html.

## Content Revision

You'd like to maintain the content of the website? Thank you!

### events page

The events page, found in file `events.html`, is coded up and built from other content, like the contents of the `_events` and `_announcements` folders. If you want to change the content shown, you'll want to change the content in these two folders.

The events shown as upcoming can be found in the `_events` folder. We use Jekyll's support of `collections` for events and announcements. To ensure the file name is unique, the filename should be in the form `yyyy-mm-dd-title.md`. The rest of the information that can be customized to provide titles, images, and ticket links is in the "front matter," or the section at the top between the lines with three dashes `---`; these three dashes are required, and tell Jekyll to compile and process the page.

An preconfigured template of a markdown file can be found in `_templates/entry-template.md`.

### home page

Much of the home page is coded up, and built from other content. However, if you'd like to change the text introducing Prachtsaal on the homepage, you can edit it in index.md. 

```
---                           (1)
layout: home                  (2)
title: Prachtsaal Studio      (3)
subtitle: ...                 (4)
description: ...              (5)
---                           (1)
Prachtsaal (magnificent hall) stands as a nexus of arts,    (6)
```
- (1) delineates the front matter, is required
- (2) required configuration for the framework (Jekyll)
- (3) main title text for home page
- (4) subtitle text for home page
- (5) text the describes the page for search engines
- (6) text content on home page, in markdown

If you want to change anything related to spacing and design, you'll need to change the html and/or the css.

### people page
The people page, which is found at `people.html`, is automatically built from text files in the `_members` directory and `_data/communities.yml` file.

If a member hasn't submitted member page text or images, you can force that a link not be created to a member page from the people page. This is done by making sure there is nothing past the front matter, meaning, if the last line in the member markdown file is the second `---`.

#### member pages

Each member has their own markdown (`*.md`) file. The stuff at the top ("front matter") is data that can be accessed by the script that builds the people page, and each member's page. It defines text, and where relevant files are.

```
---                           (1)
layout: member                (2)
full_name: ...                (3)
description: ...              (4)
thumb: ...                    (5)
portrait: ...                 (6)
portfolio_image_locations:
  - /assets/img/members/...   (7)
  - /assets/img/members/...   (7)
website: https://...          (8)
socials:                      
  - https://...               (9)
  - https://...               (9)
---                           (1)

This is the text of your personal page. (10)
```

- (1) delineates the front matter, is required
- (2) required configuration for the framework (Jekyll)
- (3) shown in list view, and personal page
- (4) shown in list view, text the describes the page for search engines
- (5) location of image in list view
- (6) location of portrait in personal page
- (7) file location of portfolio image shown in personal page
- (8) website url. If more than one, use a list like in socials.
- (9) list the links to your socials.
- (10) the text you want shown on your personal page



#### communities section

The information for the communities section is stored as a data file in `_data/communities.yml`. It is in YAML format. Please see the desired format below.

```
- name: Tape Over                               (1)
  thumb: /assets/img/communities/tapeover.jpeg  (2)
  website: https://tapeover.berlin/             (3)
  visible: true                                 (4)

- name: Xemantic
  thumb: /assets/img/communities/xemantic.png
  website: https://xemantic.com/
  visible: true

...
```
- (1) The name of the organization. The dash indicates a new organization. 
- (2) The logo, if available
- (3) The website to link to.
- (4) If the organization should be shown in the communities section

If you want to change anything related to spacing and design, you'll need to change the html and/or the css.


## [WIP] Development

You'd like to develop the design elements and code for the website? Thank you! 

This website is built using Jekyll and tailwindcss. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) uses [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) to process templates. Both html files and markdown files can include what's called front matter, which is a section at the top of the page with key value pairs - we use the yaml formatting.

To develop for this website, you'll need to install ruby (language Jekyll is written in), Jekyll, and node.js(used to install tailwind), and tailwind. There is an installation guide below.

### To install the required `npm` dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### To serve the website locally

#### Short story
While you are developing, in one terminal instance, run

```bash
npm run build-css
```

which watches for any changes, and rebuilds `styles.css`.

In another terminal, run

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
which serves the website at http://localhost:4000/
Any changes will be automatically deployed, though you will need to reload your website to see the changes.

#### Long story
The way tailwind works is that it only builds and includes the css that you are using in your website. Therefore, as you build a website, you'll need to rebuild the css with tailwind, to ensure that the css classes defined in tailwind are included. Tailwind will take what's in `/assets/css/source.css` and rebuild it to `/assets/css/styles.css`. This `styles.css` is what is included into the html. If you want to customize your own css and classes, add them to `source.css` to ensure it's included in `styles.css`. The command to build to `styles.css` is documented in `package.json` as an `npm` script `buid-css`. This command will watch for changes and update `styles.css` on the fly.

### Design considerations

The way the website has been developed is it has anticipated that the files that non-technical contributors will want to work with are in markdown, for relative ease of editing. These pages are individual event pages, individual announcements pages, individual member pages, the about page, and the home page. 

Specifically:
- events are in the `_events` folder. `events` is a collection in Jekyll, defined in the `_config.yml` file. This means that all the data in the `_events` folder can be accessed via `site.events`. Each event has its own markdown file, which uses the `_layouts/entry.html` layout.
- announcements items are in the `_announcements` folder. `announcements` is a collection in Jekyll, defined in the `_config.yml` file. This means that all the data in the `_announcements` folder can be accessed via `site.announcements`. Each announcement has its own markdown file, which uses the `_layouts/entry.html` layout.
- member pages are in the `_members` folder. `members` is a collection in Jekyll, defined in the `_config.yml` file. This means that all the data in the `_members` folder can be accessed via `site.members`. Each member has their own markdown file, which uses the `_layouts/member.html` layout.
- the about page is an example of a generic text only page, which uses the `_layouts/page.html` layout.
- the home page is a custom page, but because there is a little bit of text in it, it is a layout, that can be called by the `index.md` file. That way, the text for the home page, and the titles, can be changed relatively easily.

What's not in markdown are the events and people pages, which compile information in other files, and layouts, which are html templates that markdown files will use, named in the front matter with the key `layout`. These html files are mostly Liquid templating language, html, and tailwind css classes. 

The events page has two sections, an upcoming events section, and an events portfolio. by date at build time (only future dates are considered), and then at load time, javascript (`/assets/js/future_events.js`) will further remove events that are in the past. The events portfolio section filters all posts (including the `announcements` category) on the tag `portfolio`. If a future event has been labeled with the tag `portfolio`, it will be shown in the events porfolio section.

All the pages use the layout `default.html` - this layout includes the navigation bar and footer, and required js and css. The html for the navigation bar is at `_includes/navigation.html`, and the html for the footer is at `_includes/footer.html`.

When you create a pull request, a GitHub action called [PR Preview Action](https://github.com/rossjrw/pr-preview-action) 
will run automatically, creating a preview website to verify
everything looks good before the team decides to accept the pull request. The URL of that temporary
website will be visible in a auto-generated comment under the pull request.
It will look like `https://prachtsaal.github.io/prachtsaal.berlin/pr-preview/pr-NN/`,
where NN is the pull request number.
