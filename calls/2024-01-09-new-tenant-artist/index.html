    Here is the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XK5AtJL7JwCNUkvwNr9UbJcTWhCrHDYF/view?usp=sharing">catalog of our work</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The open space (area: 342 m2) is divided in a total of 10 ateliers, and half of one of them is available practically
    any time, for example since 15 of January 2024. This space is shared with Martyna, the painter.
  </p>
  <p>Details:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Half of Unit 2, 245 €/month, 10 m2</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You’re super welcome to drop by and check the space in person while also meeting Martyna.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, there’s a nice luminous foyer that we’re currently using for our exhibitions, a kitchen, a
    Kellar, a garden (80 m2), a wood workshop, and an area (50 m2) which will be soon made into a venue suitable for
    events (such as workshops, concerts, art exhibitions, etc.).
  </p>
  <p>
    On this note, it’s important to add that most of the current tenants are in the process of constituting a non-profit
    cooperative (Genossenschaft): if you’re interested in collaborating with us and shape the vision of Prachtsaal as a
    full on artistic pole of culture and education, we’ll be more than happy to share further information with you and
    consider your application as one of the members. Alternatively, you can also just rent your own space.
