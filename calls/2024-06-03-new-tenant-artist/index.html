    Here is the quick visual journey over Prachtsaal:
  </p>
  {% include figure.html src="/assets/img/news/foyer.webp" title="The entry of Prachtsaal" %}
  {% include figure.html src="/assets/img/news/pgarden.webp" title="Our garden" %}
  {% include figure.html src="/assets/img/news/punit6-02.webp" title="Unit 6 from the outside (mezzanine)" %}
  <p>
    Here is the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XK5AtJL7JwCNUkvwNr9UbJcTWhCrHDYF/view?usp=sharing">catalog of
    our work</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The open space (area: 342 m<sup>2</sup>) is divided in a total of 10 ateliers.
  </p>
  <p>The available areas are:</p>
  <b>Unit 3</b>
  <p>425 €/month, 18.2 m2, can host a maximum of 3 people</p>
  {% include figure.html src="/assets/img/news/punit3-01-01.webp" title="Unit 3 available for rent. €424.26/month for 18 m2." %}
  <b>Unit 6</b>
  <p>235 €/month, 15.4 m2 in total shared (to be shared with another artist)</p>
  {% include figure.html src="/assets/img/news/unit6-01.webp" title="Unit 6 (mezzanine)" %}
  {% include figure.html src="/assets/img/news/unit6-03.webp" title="Unit 6 available for rent. 235 €/month, 15.4 m2 in total shared." %}
  <p>
    You’re super welcome to drop by and check the spaces in person while also meeting us.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, there’s a nice luminous foyer that we’re currently using for our exhibitions, a kitchen, a
    Kellar, a garden (80 m<sup>2</sup>), a wood workshop, and an area (50 m<sup>2</sup>) which will be soon made into a
    venue suitable for
    events (such as workshops, concerts, art exhibitions, etc.).
  </p>
  <p>
    On this note, it’s important to add that most of the current tenants are in the process of forming a non-profit
    cooperative (Genossenschaft): if you’re interested in collaborating with us and shape the vision of Prachtsaal as an
    artistic nexus of culture and education, we’ll be more than happy to share further information with you and
    consider your application as one of the members.
  </p>

  <h2>Applying</h2>

  <p>
    If you are interested, please send your application to:
    <a href="mailto:&#105;&#110;&#102;&#111;&#64;&#112;&#114;&#97;&#99;&#104;&#116;&#115;&#97;&#97;&#108;&#46;&#98;&#101;&#114;&#108;&#105;&#110;">&#105;&#110;&#102;&#111;&#64;&#112;&#114;&#97;&#99;&#104;&#116;&#115;&#97;&#97;&#108;&#46;&#98;&#101;&#114;&#108;&#105;&#110;</a>
    including your portfolio, and an artist CV. If you don't have a CV, no worries, please send us any links to your
    online presence, and a list of relevant performances, exhibitions, residencies, or education.
    The space is only to be used as an art atelier, so we just would like to see that you do have an art practice of
    some kind.
  </p>

  <h3>Next steps</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>You visit the studio.
    <li>You have a video call with studio members. This is because the members have very varied schedules, and may not
      be in the studio when you come visit.
    <li>Because the studio is an art cooperative, the cooperative members will vote on new members. We will let you know
      after the vote, which will take at least a week to give members time to vote.
  </ul>
