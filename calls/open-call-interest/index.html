    Prachtsaal Studio is a beautiful open space in Neukölln (halfway between U-Leinestraße and U-Hermannstraße).
    The former theatre space (area: 342 m<sup>2</sup>) is divided in a total of 10 ateliers. 
    Studio vacancies come up sporadically, but if you'd be interested in joining, or at least collaborating,
    we'd love to hear from you.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are interested, please send an email to: 
    <a href="mailto:&#105;&#110;&#102;&#111;&#64;&#112;&#114;&#97;&#99;&#104;&#116;&#115;&#97;&#97;&#108;&#46;&#98;&#101;&#114;&#108;&#105;&#110;">&#105;&#110;&#102;&#111;&#64;&#112;&#114;&#97;&#99;&#104;&#116;&#115;&#97;&#97;&#108;&#46;&#98;&#101;&#114;&#108;&#105;&#110;</a>
    including your portfolio, and an artist CV. If you don't have a CV, no worries, please send us any links to your online presence, and a list of relevant performances, exhibitions, residencies, or education. 
          The space is only to be used as an art atelier, so we just would like to see that you do have an art practice of some kind.
  </p>

    artist), Lamia (tape artist/mixed media artist), Marta (illustrator/graphic designer), Martyna (painter), Robert

    Here is a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XK5AtJL7JwCNUkvwNr9UbJcTWhCrHDYF/view?usp=sharing">catalog of our work</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    There’s a nice luminous foyer that we’re currently using for our exhibitions, a kitchen, a
    Kellar, a garden (80 m<sup>2</sup>), a wood workshop, and an area (50 m<sup>2</sup>) which will be soon made into a venue suitable for
    events (such as workshops, concerts, art exhibitions, etc.).
  </p>
  <p>
    Most of the current tenants are in the process of forming a non-profit
    cooperative (Genossenschaft): if you’re interested in collaborating with us and shape the vision of Prachtsaal as an
    artistic nexus of culture and education, we’ll be more than happy to share further information with you.
