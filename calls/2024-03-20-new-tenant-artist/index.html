  <p>
    We’re looking for one or two people to join us at Prachtsaal Studio, our beautiful open space in
    Neukölln (halfway between U-Leinestraße and U-Hermannstraße)!
  </p>
  <p>
    You’ll be meeting Chloe (painter), Javi (mixed media artist), Julia (illustrator/psychologist), Kazik (generative
    artist), Lamia (tape artist/mixed media artist), Marta (illustrator/graphic designer), Martyna (painter), Robert
    (tape artist/installation artist), Stephan (mixed media artist), Valerio (painter/graphic designer),
    Liza (visual poet), Mason (video artist), Hani (photographer, video/installation artist),
    Abe (generative/computational artist), Claudine (multimedia artist), Grit (animator, visual and generative artist), and more!

    Here is the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XK5AtJL7JwCNUkvwNr9UbJcTWhCrHDYF/view?usp=sharing">catalog of our work</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The open space (area: 342 m2) is divided in a total of 10 ateliers, and one of them is available as of now.
    You can rent the whole unit, or half of it.
  </p>
  <p>Details:</p>
  {% include figure.html src="unit7-square.jpg" title="Unit available for rent" %}

  <ul>
    <li>€390/month, 15.4 m2, can host a maximum of 2 people. (You can rent half of it for €195/mo.)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    You’re super welcome to drop by and check the space in person while also meeting us.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, there’s a nice luminous foyer that we’re currently using for our exhibitions, a kitchen, a
    Kellar, a garden (80 m2), a wood workshop, and an area (50 m2) which will be soon made into a venue suitable for
    events (such as workshops, concerts, art exhibitions, etc.).
  </p>
  <p>
    On this note, it’s important to add that most of the current tenants are in the process of forming a non-profit
    cooperative (Genossenschaft): if you’re interested in collaborating with us and shape the vision of Prachtsaal as a
    full on artistic nexus of culture and education, we’ll be more than happy to share further information with you and
    consider your application as one of the members.
