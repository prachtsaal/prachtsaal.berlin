My name is Kazik Pogoda and xemantic is a label I have been using as an umbrella for my projects. The Xemantic collective was born out of numerous collaborations with people sharing the same values. We usually meet and collaborate in Berlin, at Prachtsaal Studio, a beautiful space in the middle of Neukölln district.

I am working as a software architect for NGOs like Krisenchat, and as a creative technologist — a fancy phrase to say that instead of using Adobe products I write my own software. Achieving the aesthetics I desire requires writing a custom code. The practice is called creative coding, and the outcome is called generative art or generative design. I feel neither like an artist nor like a designer. I majored in philosophy and what I create is rather reflecting my philosophical believes on the evolution extending far beyond the context of biology, also to human culture, where suddenly the new fabric of reality is woven out of our symbiosis with the machines.

I enjoy speaking their languages and I understand them well. But my love stays with humans. I love to collaborate, because it always brings additional humanistic narrative and dimension to my own work, when it is becoming part of some bigger story to tell.
