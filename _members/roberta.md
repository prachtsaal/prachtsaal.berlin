I am a Berlin-based visual artist and filmmaker with a holistic approach to creativity.
My artistic vision is all about crafting vibrant images that blur the line between reality and
dreams, blending surrealism with humour or sometimes nostalgia.

I weave narratives that explore themes of diversity, feminism and human connections, and
find my sense of belonging in a constantly evolving space where change feels like home.

I resonate with the idea of surpassing dualities, boundaries, or classifications, embracing an
expanded work practice which involves painting, filmmaking, photography, and music.
