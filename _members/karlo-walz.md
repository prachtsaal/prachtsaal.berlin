My work explores the depths of human emotions through facial expressions, gestures and nuances captured in photography. I am driven to see and analyze these elements and translate it into a picture . In my paintings, I strive to create a more reflective space—one that acts as a mirror for the spiritual part in us viewer. By pushing the boundaries of each medium, I aim to weave them together into a unified artistic language.

TL;NR I make photography, painting, sculptures and performances with a little bit of an obsession but aiming to impact with art in a spiritual way.
