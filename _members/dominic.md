Most art I create is by the examination of myself. I like to travel far in mind; not so much physically.
My motivation has its origins in curiosity and the desire to experiment, create and manipulate. I want to share my explorations so that they also move other people - and not just myself. I like to bring things together from different perspectives. Besides I would describe myself as a ‘coincidence provoker', restless pioneer, critical creative & progressive synthesizer. 

I took the route of the realization of projects in graphic design, plastic arts and digital arts as an independent artist. I participated in several band projects for 13 years. I like to find myself within mutual inspiration, composing, collaboration and immersion.
