Claudine enjoys playing at the intersection of art, science, hardware and software. Long-time engaged in community building, her favorite themes are equity, empathy, and human connection in the presence of systems. She is also driven to express the tensions and trade-offs experienced in real-life. She works in video, interactive media, and sculpture.
