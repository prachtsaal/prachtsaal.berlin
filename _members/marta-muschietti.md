Marta is a writer, researcher and art director with a background in editorial and graphic design. Her practice explores the visualization of the invisible — emotional architectures, hidden systems and psychic landscapes — through narrative, installation, performance and visual media. She focuses on building perceptual environments, using ambiguity both as a method and as an active zone of disorientation.


She is drawn to the idea of multiverses and parallel realities not only as speculative frameworks but as fractured, coexisting worlds that bleed into one another, like human perception: partial, unstable and embodied. Storytelling becomes a conceptual tool and at the same time a way of building spaces, whether mental, physical or otherwise. Her approach often weaves together references from esoteric traditions and contemporary technologies, framed as systems of power, revelation and control. A personal grounding in gaming logic and systems thinking informs how she structures narratives, scripts experiences and invites others into layered environments where rules shift, expectations warp and meaning emerges through navigation. Part of her work is also dedicated to making complex ideas accessible, translating abstract configurations into tangible forms without flattening their ambiguity.


At Prachtsaal, she develops research-led projects that blur the line between curating and storytelling, often working across text, performance and visual composition. She treats publishing as an art form in itself, a medium where rhythm, layout and conceptual density shape how knowledge is encountered. Her work inhabits the porous boundary between fiction and documentation, theory and sensation. One of her key intentions is to create accessible yet disorienting devices for thought, spaces that destabilize the familiar and open new cognitive terrain without imposing conclusions.
