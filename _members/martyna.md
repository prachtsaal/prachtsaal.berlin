Martyna Lebryk is a visual artist working in painting and sculpture. Born in Poland, she works between Dublin and Berlin. She is exploring certain ambiguities and contradictions surrounding the world, the self and human existence. She is in search of something crude. Basic human emotions. Attraction and repulsion; the need to approach and withdraw; curiosity and sin. What it means to have agency and self-determination while being constrained by own physicality and preconceptions.
