# Prachtsaal eG Constitution

## Preamble

Prachtsaal (magnificent hall) stands as a nexus of arts, culture, and education, historically deeply woven into the social fabric of Berlin's Neukölln district. This architectural gem built in 1913 has welcomed dancers, actors, musicians, and artists from diverse mediums, as well as audiences in search of a unique cultural experience, newfound knowledge, skills, and beauty. We want to continue this tradition.

### Who are we?

The "Prachtsaal eG" is a creative center carried by two legs that interact, mutually support and inspire each other. One leg is made up of an international group of resident artists who use the space for their creative work, the other leg serves the public by offering an experimental space for expression, exploration, exchange and education. We aim for the space to be in a spirit of playfulness and meaning, of movement and introspection, of colour and sound, discovery and growth. We welcome all who come in an attitude of openness, tolerance and curiosity. We call ourselves Prachtsaalians and act as a non-profit cooperative (gemeinnützige Genossenschaft).

### What are we aiming at?

We are aiming at:

- showcasing visual arts, music, and performances that embody creative expression across all mediums, while intersecting with the realms of humanities, society, science, and technology;
- involving our local community into the creative work;
- providing affordable ateliers for artists;
- educating all generations in art techniques and culture;
- promoting international artist collaborations on-site.

### How are we achieving these aims?

Facing the public, we want to achieve these aims by:

- curating inclusive events for the benefit of the local community and a wider audience,
- offering spaces and shared facilities to enable the exploration of various mediums,
- fostering a safe environment of diversity and inclusivity,
- facilitating physical access to the area by making it easy to explore and use for people with disabilities,

Internally, we want to achieve these aims by:

- upholding a democratic governance process,
- seeking professional support to fulfill our mission,
- undertaking required renovations and reconstructions,
- achieving economic sustainability of the project,
- ensuring non-profit status of Prachtsaal.

## I. Company name, registered office, purpose, and agreements between Members

### § 1 Company name and registered office

(1) The Cooperative's company name is: Prachtsaal eG.

(2) The registered office of the Cooperative is in Berlin.

(3) The text of this Constitution is formulated pursuant to the German Cooperative Societies Act (Genossenschaftsgesetz, hereinafter GenG).

### § 2 Purpose of the Cooperative

(1) The Prachtsaal eG (corporation), with its registered office in Berlin, pursues exclusively and directly charitable purposes within the meaning of the section "Tax-privileged purposes" of the German Tax Code (Abgabenordnung).

(2) The purpose of the corporation is to promote arts, culture, education and creativity in the local community and a wider audience through joint operations of the Members, while providing them with optimal conditions for creative expression.

(3) The statutory purpose is achieved in particular through activities of any kind with the aim of promoting arts and culture. The Cooperative particularly provides the space for showcasing art, the meeting point for the community, the space and facilities supporting creation of artwork and a framework for continuous art cultivation, curation and education. The statutory purpose is also achieved by raising funds and passing them on to other non-profit corporations in accordance with § 58 paragraph 1 AO, which must use these funds exclusively and directly to promote arts and/or culture and/or education and/or local community.

(4) The corporation operates selflessly and does not primarily pursue its own economic purposes.

(5) The corporation's funds may only be used for statutory purposes. Members shall not receive profit shares (Gewinnanteile) or any other undue financial benefits from the Cooperative's funds in their capacity as members. All funds shall be used exclusively for the statutory charitable purposes. Upon leaving the corporation, or upon dissolution of the corporation, or if the tax-privileged purposes cease to apply, they shall not receive more than their paid-in capital contributions (business share credit (Geschäftsguthaben)) and the common value of their contributions in kind.

(6) No person may be favored through expenses that are alien to the purpose of the corporation or through disproportionately high remuneration.

(7) The Cooperative may establish branches and participate in other companies within the scope of its purpose.

(8) The expansion of business operations to non-members shall be permitted. The General Assembly shall decide on the conditions for non-member business.

### § 3 Agreements between Members

(1) The Cooperative is committed to fostering an environment that champions diversity and inclusivity among its Members, featured artists and our audience. This encompasses not only gender, nationality, and ethnicity, but also age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, socioeconomic status, religious beliefs, and other unique perspectives and backgrounds. We believe that by embracing the full spectrum of human experiences, we can better serve our community and enrich our collective work.

(2) The Cooperative pursues its statutory purpose primarily on the basis of decisions made by grassroots democracy. In its internal operations, it follows the principle of the greatest possible transparency and participation. All members and governing bodies shall be bound by these and all aforementioned basic principles of the Cooperative.

(3) This Constitution, including all the future amendments, shall be redacted in English first, so that our international Members can participate in the process. The precise German translation shall follow. Only the latter is legally binding.

(4) The part of the yearly budget of the Cooperative which is acquired through rental of art ateliers must completely cover all the constant costs including:

a. rental of the Prachtsaal space within property managed by GbR Jonasstraße 22, including adjacent garden area;
b. rental of additional spaces and storage spaces within this property;
c. operating costs (Betriebskosten) (e.g. water, electricity, heating, etc.);
d. internet and other necessary media;
e. property and asset insurance;
f. security measures required by the insurance;
g. financial costs (e.g. bank account);
h. office supplies;
i. software and service licenses;
j. cleaning;
k. duties towards companies or entities that provide lease agreements (Pachtverträge) to the Cooperative, ensuring timely payments and adherence to lease agreements, depending on the decision of General Assembly to cover these costs from the atelier rental budget;
l. additional 10% of the sum of aforementioned costs to be allocated to the Cooperative's reserves.

(5) The yearly budget of the Cooperative must also account for additional constant costs which should not be covered by rental of art ateliers, but covered from the reserves. These constant costs include:

a. legal costs associated with mandatory audit pursuant to § 4 GenG ("Prüfung und Prüfungsverbände"),
b. all the necessary insurances covering accidents involving performers, audience and staff running events at Prachtsaal (to be covered from ticket sales for the events),
c. the costs of rental deposit.

(6) The following agreements between 3rd parties and the Cooperative shall be covered by separate contracts:

a. The rental contract with GbR Jonasstraße 22 to rent the whole Prachtsaal space and agreed additional spaces of the managed property;
b. Rental contracts with artists residing in the space;
c. Contracts with Members who provide a loan to the Cooperative pursuant to § 21b GenG;
d. Contracts with companies or entities that provide leases to the Cooperative;
e. Insurance contracts with insurance providers;
f. Contracts with the electricity provider;
g. Contracts with the garbage disposal facilities;
h. Contracts with the cleaning service provider;
i. Other contracts with media and service providers necessary for fulfilling statutory purposes stated in this Constitution.

(7) In order to provide fair division of the rental burden carried by tenant artists the Prachtsaal atelier space shall be partitioned into rentable atelier units of value established in points, which relate to:

a. the unit area in square meters,
b. the amount of daylight,
c. the amount of airflow,
d. additional height of the unit,
e. privacy,
f. expected disturbance from publicly accessible spaces of Prachtsaal,
g. reduced heating,
h. location in the basement,
i. other important factors established after deliberation.

(8) The sum of incomes from all rented atelier units equals to the sum of all costs listed in paragraph 4, when divided by 12 months. The monthly rental cost specified in each individual rental contract between the Cooperative and a tenant artist must be calculated according to the formula:

$$r = \frac{a}{s} \times \frac{c}{12}$$

Where:

- $r$ = monthly rental cost of the atelier unit
- $a$ = value points assigned to the atelier unit according to paragraph 7
- $s$ = sum of all the value points of all atelier units
- $c$ = sum of rental costs listed in paragraph 4

The calculated $r$ value should be rounded up to the closest value of Euro cents.

**Example:**

$$r = \frac{20}{180} \times \frac{€50400}{12} = 0.1111 \times €4200 = €466.67$$

Where:

- $a = 20$ (value points of the atelier unit)
- $s = 180$ (value points of all atelier units)
- $c = €50400$ (the sum of yearly rental costs listed in paragraph 4)
- $r = €466.67$ (the monthly rental cost of the atelier unit)

(9) All costs listed in paragraph 4, as well as rules for assigning value points to atelier units, shall be revised annually for the upcoming fiscal year. This revision results in changes to the rental cost of each atelier unit. Therefore, a new calculation must occur before September 1st of each fiscal year. This allows sufficient time to communicate any resulting change in the monthly rental cost of each atelier unit to tenant artists in advance. Tenant artists will then have the opportunity to either sign a contract addendum with the updated rental price or terminate the rental contract with the agreed notice period. Due to the nature of the Cooperative's yearly budget planning, each rental contract between the Cooperative and a tenant artist shall contain a clause allowing for adjustment of the rental price for each fiscal year.

(10) Additional income of the Cooperative can be acquired through:

a. fundraising campaigns focused on particular projects to be realized by the Cooperative;
b. ticket sales for the events happening at Prachtsaal;
c. commissions from ticket sales for workshops and educational events happening at Prachtsaal;
d. sales of beverages and food during these events in compliance with rules and guidelines for hospitality services in Germany;
e. commissions from the artwork sold while being exhibited at Prachtsaal (to be regulated by resolutions of the Cooperative and written agreements with the artists);
f. rental of the public spaces of Prachtsaal to 3rd parties for the purposes aligned with the Cooperative's statutory purpose;
g. financial donations;
h. donations in kind (to be individually inspected and accepted, to prevent receiving a liability);
i. sales of goods and services directly related to the purpose of the Cooperative, including online education.

(11) Additional income shall be spent only on purposes aligned with the Cooperative's statutory purpose, and described in this Constitution, including:

a. payments for artists performing during events happening at Prachtsaal;
b. payments for technicians and staff supporting these events;
c. payments for curators and organizers of these events;
d. payments for other professionals performing required work on behalf of the Cooperative (e.g. lawyers, builders, architects);
e. costs related to organization of art residencies at Prachtsaal;
f. charitable contributions to the community in the areas of art and education;
g. production costs;
h. marketing costs;
i. licenses;
j. payments for paying off loans and leases;
k. purchase of an artwork exhibited at Prachtsaal, to form the Prachtsaal Art Collection (excluding the artwork of the Members of the Cooperative);
l. plans, materials, work and all the other means required to conduct renovations and constructions;
m. specialized equipment needed for events;
n. art supplies and building materials required by educational workshops and collaborations between the Members of the Cooperative.

(12) Projects and associated fundraising campaigns mentioned in paragraph 10a can be managed by the Members of the Cooperative, as well as by external curators and fundraisers in coordination with the Cooperative. The scope of these projects shall cover a variety of themes related to Cooperative's statutory purpose.
