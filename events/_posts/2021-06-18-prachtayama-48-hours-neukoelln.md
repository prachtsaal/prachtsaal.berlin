An group exhibition inspired by Pranayama - The fusion of body and mind through breathing exercises in Yogic teachings. Our goal is to stimulate the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system.

<br>
The centerpiece of the exhibition will be a collaborative, interdisciplinary installation.
The combination of multiple techniques and guided breathing exercises creates an interactive experience in which visitors get empowered and connected with themselves.

<br>
With a variety of media such as painting, tape art, interactive installations, sculpture, digitally and olfactory elements, visitors will encounter the theme of "AIR" and thus be stimulated in a very diverse way, to multidimensional reflections.
