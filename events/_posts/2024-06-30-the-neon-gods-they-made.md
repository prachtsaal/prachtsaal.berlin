The Neon Gods They Made, is a fragment of
lyrics from the song “The Sound of Silence” sung
by Simon & Garfunkel. Silence in the metropolis
means the comfort of not being overstimulated
by the sound. But absolute silence can be also a
form of sensory deprivation used to torture
people, to break their silence. The meaning of
“silence” is differential, not referential. We know
it only through the opposite term, which we
understand better - the “silence” is a lack of
sound, music, noise. As thematized in the Song,
social silence comes from indifference, sometimes
taboo or collective guilt or even denial, it is an
embodiment of the alienation present in postmodern
living conditions. In contrast, breaking the
silence is a common theme of contemporary
liberty movements that ask us to not stay indifferent
to the silencing of marginalized voices.

During 48h Neukölln 2024 we would like to
present an exhibition “The Neon Gods They
Made”, created in curated effort of all our
resident artists. We want to meditate on all the
aspects of silence in modernity, including
discomforting ones. At the same time we fully
embrace Wittgensteinian “wovon man nicht
sprechen kann, darüber muss man schweigen” -
the most significant phenomena of our lives
cannot be expressed in words, therefore we will
try to express something important in imagery
and movement, but in silence.

Our foyer is acting as an art gallery presenting
paintings, our garden will host installations, our
newly established immersive multimedia venue
will teleport visitors into the surreal interactive
and exploratory experience. Using paintings,
calligraphy, tape art, plotters, epoxy, digital
illustrations, installations, performance, code and
generative art we want to create an immersive
space that thematises the apprehension of
silence.
