    It was an exciting in-person event at Prachtsaal Studio. We were thrilled
    to have <a href="https://reas.com/">Casey Reas</a> as our special guest for a special reading of the
    <a href="https://processingfoundation.org/advocacy/community-catalog">20th
      Anniversary Processing Community Catalog</a>,
    a celebration of the art+tech community. This nearly 1000-page book celebrates the achievements and creativity of
    the <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a> community,
    featuring open-call submissions from those who've explored the potential of Processing,
    p5.js, and beyond.

    We were honored to have Casey Reas joining us for this reading. With Ben Fry, Reas launched Processing in 2001.
    Processing is an open-source programming language and environment for the visual arts. Processing is widely used by
    thousands of artists and designers worldwide and by educators teaching programming fundamentals in art and design
    schools.
