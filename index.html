  <p>
    Prachtsaal (magnificent hall) stands as a nexus of arts, culture, and education, historically deeply woven into the
    social fabric of Berlin's Neukölln district. This architectural gem built in 1913 has welcomed dancers, actors,
    musicians, and artists from diverse mediums, as well as audiences in search of a unique cultural experience,
    newfound knowledge, skills, and beauty.
  </p>
  <p>
    The “Prachtsaal eG” (registration pending) is a creative center carried by two legs that interact, mutually support
    and inspire each other. One leg is made up of a group of resident artists who use the space for their creative work,
    the other leg serves the public by offering an experimental space for expression, exploration, exchange and
    education.
    We aim for the space to be in a spirit of playfulness and meaning, of movement and introspection, of colour and
    sound, discovery and growth. We welcome all who come in an attitude of openness, tolerance and curiosity. We act as
    a non-profit cooperative:

      showcasing visual arts, music, and performances that embody creative expression across all mediums, while
      intersecting with the realms of humanities, society, science, and technology,
    </li>
    <li>ensuring non-profit status of Prachtsaal,</li>
    <li>undertaking required renovations and reconstructions,</li>
